Changes - 16th November 2009
----------------------------

There are too many changes. it's hard to tell all, but:

- A lot of desync fixes. Older versions cannot read the new
  savestate. Also, a new sync flag is added to SMV. Most
  SMV editors might not care about the new flag byte.
  Be careful, or you might experience a desync.             (nitsuja)
- Some minor fixes on sound code.                           (gocha)
- Fix flag checking of SuperFX code.                        (@gochaism @757_ @homingA @33953YoShI)
- Lua: added Lua from 1.43. some functions works buggy,
  and some functions are not implemented yet.               (gocha)
- Win32: added Gens compatible RAM Watch and RAM Search.
  Old search is still left. You can convert old watchlist
  by using it.                                              (gocha)
- Win32: added trace logger. (ported from bsnes)            (gocha, byuu)
- Win32: Merged OV2's new sound code.                       (OV2)
