v3.9.0 Internal
_________________

- Cycle precision system ("events") for all ACIA I/O (6301, MIDI) when
option C1 is checked (it doesn't mean the emulation is 100% accurate).

- Some refactoring and source code simplification.


v3.9.0 Bugfixes
_________________

- Remove HD/TOS warning (a 'bad idea' fix).

- No warning for STF/T206, they're compatible.

- Reorganisation of option names in steem.ini (example, there were "Options"
and "Option" sections).
Because of that, first startup may be confusing, but it had to be done 
one day.

- If, unlikely as it is, Steem crashes, it will report the exception number 
and position in a message box, and then close cleanly if possible.

- Auto select TOS on load snapshot: try to match country.

- Clicks on some DMA sounds (Talk Talk 2).

- Reading Joypads when the program doesn't respect conventions (Substation).

- WD1772: delay on SEEK when DR=TR (Suretrip II STW).

- ACIA transmission on accelerated ST (option C1 for 6301 and MIDI).

- MC68000: some timing corrections (using Yacht table).

- Drive speed in "accurate" mode (Necrosys, Oh No More Froggies).

- Joystick port 0 with option C1 (TNT).

- Screenshot with normal (small) size (D3D build).

- Win64 build: fix some GUI crashes.

- File handle leak when using ArchiveAccess.dll.

- CAPS some drive sounds missing.

- Some crashes on load snapshot (option C2).

- Crash on change R/W when STW/HFE disk inserted.

- Save as Neo: save correct resolution.

- Resetting in medium resolution could cause shifted planes, low resolution
display.

- Fullscreen crisp rendering: trash when switching resolutions

- DefaultSnapshot in ini file interfering with dropping disk image file on Steem
