v3.9.1 Features
_________________

- Save PNG or JPG screenshots without FreeImage.dll (D3D).

- Fullscreen: new option to use the desktop refresh rate (D3D).


v3.9.1 Emulation improvements
_______________________________

- Delay before bus error triggers.

- Blitter:
  In blit mode, the blitter can interrupt an operation between read and write.
  The CPU can surrender bus control during an instruction.
  Steem emulates this, but it's not 100% accurate.
