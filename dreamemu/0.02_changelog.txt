SH-4 CPU:
	 Rewrote CPU Interpreter Core: Increased speed and accuracy
Graphics: 
	 2D Framebuffer: RGB565 mode implemented, graphics drawing speed increased, corrected screen update rate (still not accurate)
Debugger:
	 Disassembly: The amount of disassembly to process can now be controlled by the user.
		      The whole memory area does not need to be disassembled, although this is possible
 		      too. (Note: not all regions can be disasm'ed yet...have to rewrite the debugger so I didnt bother adding these in yet)
Emulator:
 	 Command Line: -lx command line option added
 	 Header Information: Got rid of the error message and correct device information is now shown
         Support for scrambled boot files added

IMPORTANT NOTE: Unlike the last release, in which you needed 32bit colour to run, in this release
	        you MUST set your desktop colour to 16bit. Setting it to 32bit wont crash Dreamemu,
		it will just show the wrong colours. Support for the different desktop colour depths
		will be added shortly.

New Software working: Stars Demo
                      640x80 example
		      argb8888 example (not showing correctly now)

There could be more...I havent tried much...please inform me if there is!
