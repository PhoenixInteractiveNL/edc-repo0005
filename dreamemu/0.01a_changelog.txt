*3. What's New
**************************

Pretty much everthing since its a new release! :)

Almost full CPU emulation (approx. 30 opcodes need to be added)
FPU emulation started
Most PowerVR registers identifed and emulated
2D Graphics Output from VRAM using Direct Draw
Detailed Memory Map drawn up
Disassembler complete apart from FPU opcodes
Register debugger - contains some SH-4 Registers and PowerVR registers
Debug Console - basic debug console showing errors etc.
Translate instuction function from Hex to Mnemonic (some errors)
IP.BIN display and editor
Tiny Ini file

Because I wanted to release this week, somethings that I should
have implemented are not present (they are not major)
1. Some of the image information is not complete (only the information 
   on the far left is done)
2. You cannot switch resoulutions/screen sizes easily
3. Add 16/24 bit colour support
4. Reset Emulation does not work properly
5. Disasm/Memory/Registers displays arn't complete or laid out 
   in the best possible way.
6. Emulation is very slow.
7. Boot file descrambling support
8. SH-4 FPU/Serial interface/MMU etc.

There are others, and there are lots of things I have to improve/add
but expect some of these things in the next release, coming soon (I hope)!
Send your feedback to me please!
