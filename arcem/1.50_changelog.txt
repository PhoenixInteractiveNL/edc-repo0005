ArcEm 1.50

New features 
  Addition of ports to Amiga OS 3 and OS 4.
  Sound emulation.
  Support for RAM sizes other than 4MB (512KB, 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 12MB & 16MB now supported).
  ARM250 & ARM3 CPU emulation.
  ArcEm clock set from host's clock, partial RTC support.
  Extension ROM emulation, allowing support for the following new features when emulation RISC OS: 
    HostFS - A RISC OS filesystem to allow use of a directory on the Host Filing system as a virtual hard drive.
    Mouse scroll wheel support.
    Extra video modes, up to 1024x768 in 16 colours and 800x600 in 256 colours.

Bug fixes/Improvements 
  Many performance tweaks and optimisations, resulting in a 5-6 times performance gain on ARM hosts. A 600MHz XScale can now achieve a level of performance roughly equivalent to an 8MHz ARM2. Similar performance gains can be seen on other low-power hosts.
  Video emulation rewritten to provide accurate redraw and VSync timing, down to the scanline level.
  Video emulation now supports upscaling and aspect ratio correction for rectangular pixel modes.
  All hardware clocks/timers (IOC timers, video DMA, audio DMA, etc.) now run in real time, ensuring one second takes one second no matter how fast the host machine is.
  Source code tidied a bit to remove redundant code, including support for emulation of 32bit processor modes (there are other, much better emulators for that!).
  Source code converted to use C99 number types to aid portability.
  Instruction prefetch now correctly emulated - ensures correct operation with self-modifying code and some forms of copy protection.
  RISC OS version now 32bit compatible, and ARMv7-safe. Also much more useable with modern machines/LCD monitors as it no longer requires the host to be able to support Archimedes screen modes.
  Windows version updated to build under Visual Studio 2010 (including Express edition).
  Unix/X11 version now supports X servers that don't support XWarpPointer.
