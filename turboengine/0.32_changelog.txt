Version 0.32

* Fixed sound cracking/buzzing in CD-ROM games.

* Improved BXR/BYR latch timings (hopefully). Fixes sprite corruption in Deep Blue (J).

* Fixed a memory handler related bug which caused some games to crash Turbo Engine.

* Fixed the problem of scanlines looking ugly when Window size multiplier of 3
  is selected.
  
* Slightly improved sound mixing speed.

* Fixed a small localization DLL setting bug.
