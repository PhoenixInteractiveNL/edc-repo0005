    A command line tool that replaces snespurify and adds:
    - support for ROMs of other systems than SNES
    - creates cartridge folders for ROMs (folders for all data
      belonging to a game - will be mandatory starting from bsnes 0.089)
  * debian/bsnes-purify.6
    - Added. Manual page for bsnes-purify.
  * debian/patches/fix-purify-header-removal-and-input.patch:
    - Added. Header detection was broken and the tool didn't
      accept folder names without trailing slash.

      from 0.088-1 entry.

      and is not supported on all architectures.

    /usr/share/games/laevateinn.
    - Copy folders and symlink to files in debian/startscript/bsnes.
